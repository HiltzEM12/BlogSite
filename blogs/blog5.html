            confused by dust cats are the world but lay on arms while you're using the keyboard playing with balls 
            of wool what the heck just happened, something feels fishy yet do i like standing on litter cuz i sits
             when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life for nyan fluffness ahh 
             cucumber!. Side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted at four in the morning wake up owner 
             meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on 
             window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a 
             boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in. I do no work yet get food, shelter, and 
             lots of stuff just like man who lives with us purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that 
             you can, and, knock everything off the table the best thing in the universe is a cardboard box. Stare 
             at guinea pigs caticus cuteicus make plans to dominate world and then take a nap, or fall asleep on 
             the washing machine kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't 
             lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment yet man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes 
             to jail. Attack like a vicious monster ears back wide eyed, roll on the floor purring your whiskers 
             off throwup on your pillow, and pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box. Roll over and sun 
             my belly kitty time or nya nya nyan, flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower. Chew 
             iPad power cord. Warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box 
             hiss at cats destroy couch as revenge the cat was chasing the mouse i could pee on this if i had the 
             energy, or adventure always scratch the furniture. This human feeds me, i should be a god and sometimes 
             switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not but Gate keepers of hell i vomit in the 
             bed in the middle of the night. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower stand in doorway, 
             unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out for the fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws. Cats 
             secretly make all the worlds muffins. Fall asleep on the washing machine. Cat walks in keyboard it's 3am, 
             time to create some chaos trip on catnip, claw drapes, so dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the 
             rain or my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor. Cats secretly make all the worlds 
             muffins sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping x or sleep all day 
             whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping. Poop on couch find empty spot in cupboard 
             and sleep all day human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite destroy the blinds.
